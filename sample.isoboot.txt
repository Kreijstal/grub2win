#            This is sample code for booting from an iso file
#            via the Grub2Win g2wisoboot function
#
#            See the Grub2Win help file advanced topics section for more information
#
#            Notes: There are many many ISO files available. They are all different.
#                   You must examine your particular ISO file with a utility like 7-Zip to
#                   obtain the proper kernel and initrd paths.
#                   You can then set the kernelpath and initrdpath variables below.
#                   The kernel and initrd files will not be found unless the correct paths are set.  
#
#                   Literal strings in the setparams command must be surrounded by single quotes '
